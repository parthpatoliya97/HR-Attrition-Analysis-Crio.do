2️⃣ Role-Based Attrition (Where it hurts most)
🔹 High Attrition Roles

Laboratory Technician – 122

🔹 Low Attrition Roles

🔍 Observation

Attrition exists across all satisfaction levels, but:

Higher exits seen at low-to-mid satisfaction (1 & 2)

Even satisfied employees (3 & 4) are leaving

🔍 Reason

Attrition is not driven by satisfaction alone

Growth stagnation, overtime, and compensation play a stronger role

✅ Recommendations

Combine satisfaction scores with promotion & workload metrics

Conduct stay interviews, not just exit interviews

4️⃣ Overtime Impact (Strongest Driver)

Overtime Yes: 253

Overtime No: 220

Rotate workloads

Manager-level accountability on overtime usage
